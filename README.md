# Potato.
 
An incredibly simple clicker game with much action and wow!

Took 6 hours of development time, made in Godot.

Build has not been optimised, so the file size is excessive.

This is a simple and barebones proof of concept I made for the funny that people call "April Fools". It's still April 1st here in the UK, so I can get away with it.

You can find this on [itch.io](https://silencefat.itch.io/potato)!

Further work is unlikely but not out of the picture.
